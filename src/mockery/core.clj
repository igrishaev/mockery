(defmacro with-mock
  "Runs the code block substituting a target function with a dummy
  one (\"mock\" function). This dummy function behaves the way you
  determine with options. It counts the number of calls, accumulates
  it's arguments, can cause side effects or rise a given
  exception. Once you go out from the macro, the target function will
  obtain it's origin value.

  Arguments:

  - `mock`: a symbol to bind a mock instance inside the code block,

  - `opt`: a map with the following parameters:

  -- `:target` (required): a symbol or a keyword points to a target
  function to mock. May include a namespace (be full-qualified).

  -- `:return`: any value to return from a mocked function. If it's a
  function by itself (defn, fn or #(...)), it will be called
  afterwards.

  -- `:side-effect`: any function with no arguments that is triggered
  when calling a target function.

  -- `:throw`: either an Exception instance to be thrown with the
  standard `throw` pipeline or any map to be thrown with `(ex-info)`
  wrapper. Useful to simulate runtime exceptions.

  More on mock instance.

  The mock instance you have bound to the `mock` parameter is an atom
  holds a map. It extends the `opt` map described above. In addition
  to those immutable fields, it has the following ones:

  -- `:called?`: a boolean flag indicates whether a function was called
  at least one time or not. `false` by default.

  -- `:call-count`: a number times the function was called. 0 by default.

  -- `:call-args`: the last arguments were passed to the
  function. `nil` by default.

  -- `:call-args-list`: a vector of all the args were passed, `[]` by
  default.

  -- `:return`: the latest returned value.

  -- `:return-list`: a vector of all the values have ever been returned.

  Example:

  (with-mock mock
    {:target :clojure.pprint/pprint
     :return \":-)\"
     :side-effect #(println \"Hi!\")}
    (clojure.pprint/pprint {:foo 42}))

  Hi!
  :-)

  Once you deref the `mock` variable inside the code block, you'll get:

  {:called? true
   :call-count 1
   :call-args ({:foo 42})
   :call-args-list [({:foo 42})]
   :target :clojure.pprint/pprint
   :return \":-)\"
   :side-effect #function[mockery.core/eval12666/fn--12667]}

  Checking `:call-count` and `:call-args` might be good for your unit
  tests."
